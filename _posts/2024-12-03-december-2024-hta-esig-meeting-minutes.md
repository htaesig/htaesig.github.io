## 2. Member/subteam/guest driven topic (2/2)

### Extrapolation topic for 2025 conference/webinar (Arthur - 10min)

- Discussion that this topic would be relevant for both a webinar and potentially ISPOR collab
- Arthur and Min Hua will investigate potential for ISPOR session 2025
- <mark>ACTION: Arthur to share with Anders suggestion for title/topic/rationale to feed to PSI/EFSPI in webinar requests</mark>



#### Time-to-event extrapolations leveraging RWD

Potential speaker: Ash Bullement

#### Time-to-event extrapolations leveraging external CTs

E.g., in oncology setting, potential use of phase 2 data with longer
follow-up, or leverage publisehd data

Potential speaker: TBD

#### Time-to-event extrapolations using SEE

Following-up on the great sessions on SEE at ISPOR-EU 2024, focus
on statistical methods that use SEE outputs to improve long-term
extrapolations

Potential speakers

- Min-Hua
- Kate Ren (with a focus on upcoming NICE guidance)
- Christopher Jackson (author of the _survextrap_ package)

#### Time-to-event extrapolations in "special circonstances

Other interesting topics that do not entirely fit into a session on
the use of external data

- Time-to-event extrapolations adjusting for treatment switching
  (potential speaker: Claire Watkins)
- Time-to-event extrapolations in basket trials/ Tumor agnostic
  indications (Potential speaker: one author of
  https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34990339/, someone who submitted a
  tumor agnostic indication)
- Time-to-event extrapolations in subgroups/subpopulations: Probably
  similar techniques than for basket trials could be used.

## 3. EU HTA – info sharing and updates (10min)

### EU HTA Stakeholder Network Meeting 29-Nov (Anders)

#### Agenda key points

- Update on implementation of HTAR
- Breakout sessions (based on extensive guidance adopted 28-Nov, soon to be public)
  - Update on the work in the JSC subgroup
  - Update on the work in the JCA subgroup
  - Protection of commercially sensitive data and personal data in joint work
  - Identification of patient and clinical experts and other experts for the joint work
  - Joint work on medical devices
- Horizon scanning
- Stakeholder presentations
  - Including EFSPI: Open-source statistical code and its potential for EU HTA JCA

#### Many new stakeholder organizations

- 37 applications for new call, 26 additional members accepted
- EFSPI still only more statistical/technical learned society


#### Key input/learnings

- Alignment JCA table templates vs methodology guidelines?
  - --> Templates meant as a help, deviations can be justified
- Adjustments when and how? Encouraged transparency around "what works", what is used in local decision making
  - -->On an ongoing basis, requirements are comprehensive to limit need for extra local work, need to understand if too comprehensive
- Capacity + rolling calls JSC? JSC as an integral part of EU HTA.

  - --> Focus has been on JCA for now
  - --> Increasing capacity is a priority, hope that more frequent calls (quarterly?)

- JCA advice from procedural/methods SG:
  - --> provide justification and rationale; consider HTA questions **early**


#### EFSPI presentation "Open-source statistical code and its potential for EU HTA JCA"

EFSPI key points:

- Open-source statistical code for JCA work can support HTAR aspiration of reduced duplication, increased efficiency, and scientific excellence
- Built-in transparency and accountability enables ‘safe’ utilization of expertise and resources across all stakeholders
- A community-driven effort by construction – but the CG and national HTABs can catalyze and impact direction by engaging in dialogue and, in the future, pilots

Feedback from the CG

- A "glimpse of the future"
- Making open-source work at HTA bodies is indeed difficult
- Curiosity around participating in R Consortium HTA WG efforts (observer mode)

Discussion SIG meeting

- Ursula: important to have HTAB contact for the R Consortium HTA WG, need to align on what we are solving. Anders: agree, will see if we can leverage the first contact via SN more in 2025.

### New EU HTA guidance and documents (~350 pages)
