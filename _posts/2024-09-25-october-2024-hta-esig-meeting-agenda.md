## Updates from chairs
### EU HTA Stakeholder Network
Next meeting 29 Nov. Anders will join. There is a call for topics to be presented/discussed (deadline 16 Oct). Currently two consultations where stakeholder – JSC for medical devices and work programme 2025.

### PSI 2025
Wembley Stadium, London from Sunday 1st – Wednesday 4th June 2025.

Deadline for ESIG suggested sessions 23 Nov ( preferred duration of the session, the content of the session i.e. an abstract and the speakers). The call for SIG sessions notes that ‘Please be aware that given the number of SIGs and the amount of other interest we have in the PSI conference we are unable to guarantee all SIGs a slot.‘.

There is interest in having an HTA Townhall again this year (Lara). It is unlikely that we’ll have something sufficiently “new” to say about EU HTA at that point. One good alternative option would be to go for a less EU HTA focused topic like ‘patient perspective in HTA’. We’ll discuss on 01 Oct.
