## Background

At the February meeting, we decided to do a short survey to elicit input from SIG members on 2025 targets.

### Responses to 'Any other considerations that you want to share?'

- Increase visibility of statistical topics in HTA organisations or at HTA conferences.
- In 2025, I think it is important to focus on those areas of HTA statistics which are likely to become more prominent in the face of EU JCA (ITC, establishing surrogacy, establishing clinical meaningfulness, treatment switching, interpretation of low-N analysis).  Particularly, I think there is a need to educate on the limitations and interpretations of these analyses, and not simply trust methodology blindly. I think there is also scope to increase attention on the statistics used commonly in economic modelling (also ITC, extrapolation, interpretation of post hoc analyses), given its increasing use in Europe and the US
- Share insights and learnings about how to strengthen the strategic role of HTA stat. in EU HTA work (early engagement, best practices, ...)
- I feel that while JCA is important, there are so many other HTA topics that we need to be careful to not lose sight of these too!
- Some initiatives within the SIG started in 2024 to help us understand how HTA statistics is supported within different companies (e.g., proposed survey).  This could be useful for us all to help us consider best practices in how we are positioned and how we work with cross-functional colleagues
- Topics about recruitment. How can we better select suitable candidates for HTA statisticians in our companies?
- Create working groups within SIGs so that each member can better contribute towards a common goal
- Discuss role of AI and Automation in work as a HTA statistician
- Share updates about software development (seeing that openstatsware will be discussed at the next EFSPI stat lead meeting, the topic may gain in importance)
- I would like to see the ESIG organise more webinars about HTA statistics (both methodological and applied). Perhaps a journal club, with authors invited to speak.
- For meeting time, it would be nice to accommodate US attendees.

## Implications

- Information sharing on particularly EU HTA but also ex-EU HTA is at the top of the list
