## Updates from chairs

### 2025 HTA ESIG targets

At the January meeting, we didn't get around to this topic. We encourage you to think about relevant targets before we meet - you may find inspiration in our [2024 targets](https://htaesig.github.io/about/).

Some of the things that we hope to discuss:

- How to strengthen the visibility of subteams and their work?
- New subteam needed: PSI 2025 planning
  - Other subteams that we should consider (surrogacy?)
- What will it take to push the HTA training course track?
