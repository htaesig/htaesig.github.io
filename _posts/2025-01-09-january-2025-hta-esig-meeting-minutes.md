## 2. EU HTA training 2025

_Jonas Hägströmm presentation postponed_

### Reason for Jonas' visit

- The **EFSPI Scientific and Training Academy** has discussed EU HTA training as a potentially relevant topic to target in 2025 (F2F or/and virtual)
- I've talked briefly with Jonas that the ESIG has discussed something similar (with a broader focus than just EU HTA)
- Volunteers to connect with Jonas?
  - Anna Wiksten + Ash volunteer (what will be the audience?). Lara: historically, there has been more of an interest in training for non-HTA. 
  - Michael S: echoes. Hands-on + connection with methodological training for non-HTA.
  - Antonia Brozek: Ecker & Ecker might be interested as well


## 3. EU HTA - info sharing and updates

- New EU HTA guidance documents (Martin Scott) [European Commission Website](https://health.ec.europa.eu/health-technology-assessment/key-documents_en?f%5B0%5D=topic_topic%3A225&f%5B1%5D=topic_topic%3A226&f%5B2%5D=topic_topic%3A227&f%5B3%5D=topic_topic%3A228&f%5B4%5D=topic_topic%3A236)
- [Click here](/downloads/2025-01-09-january-2025-hta-esig-meeting-martin-scott-presentation.pdf) to download Martin's presentation  
- Claudia: JCA dossier template, no guidance on if/when comparative analyses needed for safety (number of events). Lara: can we propose criteria for analyzable PICOs? 
- VFA did a comparison AMNOG/JCA templates. Lena: will look into whether VFA AMNOG/JCA comparison slides can be shared with SIG (Lara: alternatively, ask your German colleagues)
