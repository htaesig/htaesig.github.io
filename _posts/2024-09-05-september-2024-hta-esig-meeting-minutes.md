## 1. Admin updates

- Any new members on the call today? Approaching member no. 100!

-  Join ESIG open-source subteam? (**Anders**)
   - Focus: thought leadership, link to HTA statisticians, complementing new initiatives including the R Consortium HTA working group (that will do a landscape/opportunity mapping)
   - Current members: Rossella, Cedric, Nermina, Amelie, Ian, Iain, Anders
   - Lara mentioned: connection/opportunities with SUSTAIN HTA

- HTA ESIG private LinkedIn group (**Anders**)
  - For sharing 'nice-to-have' information/ideas asynchronously (instead of email)
  - Will still use email for meeting invites and core SIG info
  
- We will stop doing video recordings from the meeting to simplify (minutes instead)


## 2. Member/subteam/guest driven topic

- Strengthen focus on this
- "Idea catalogue" (format pending)
  - Including both things that you want to talk about/hear about
  - **Need SIG member help to populate the catalogue!**
- Michael S: update about the German subteam
  - 14 members working on update, also framing in context of EU HTA
  - Hope to complete work by end of year


## 3. EU HTA – info sharing and updates

- EFSPI response EU HTA Stakeholder Network Survey (**Anders**)
  - For review (during August):
    - Template of requests from health technology developers (HTD) for joint scientific consultations (JSC) 
    - JSC request template for medicinal products
  - Review by Katrin, Christof/Thomas, Milana, Anders
  - Limitation on review character count, key aspects:
    - Structure of templates artificually disaggregates PICO into P, I, C, O 
    - 'Area of advice' section lacks an 'Evidence synthesis' item (very trial-focused)
      - Will also be taken up at EFSPI Regulatory Stats Workshop
 - Lara: actual IA not yet published, an issue for reviewing this

- Outreach
  - DIA GCP-QA group 12-Sep-2024 presentation (Arthur)
    - GCP-QA: good clinical practices and quality assurance, including ICH, EMA, and FDA guidelines.
	- Recent presentations highlighted simultaneous planning and submission of HTA/HEOR alongside efficacy/safety dossiers in Europe.
    - The Community is now exploring how to adapt to new guidelines by integrating HTA/HEOR considerations into trial protocols.
    - Milana: public nature of the dossier, small subgroups, data privacy etc
    - Lara: multiplicity. Fewer rules than for AMNOG dossiers (minimum thresholds etc) - "responsible" way to define a PICO?
    - Michael S, GCP update H2 2024: investigator should have access to data collected
    - Lara, relation to EU CTR guidelines, how can we align?
    - Lara, also quality in relation to SLRs + data extracts, what role does QA play?
  - EU HTA  2025 in the Nordics 23-Oct-2024 presentation/Copenhagen Centre for Regulatory Science (Anders)
    - Pertinent statistical issues  EU HTA JCA
- 19-Sep-2024 CIRS: HTA Strategic Forum (not open), Lara (or Tina) may be able to provide an update/report
- EAA https://www.euaac.org/conventions  
- Other EU HTA news/insights?
  - Methodology whitepaper
  - Expecting IA on JSC soon, will want to review as SIG
  - EFPIA HTA WG: metrics for JCA implementation

## 5. AOB
- Lara: is anyone involved in structured expert elicitation? There's openness with NICE and ZIN for sth like this. Would like to hear more.
  - Min-Hua: ISPOR EU workshop (includes Kate Ren)
  
## Post-meeting note Min-Hua

With regard to Structured Expert Elicitation (SEE), Kate Ren and I are currently engaged in a methodological study focused on long-term survival projections using SEE. We plan to extend this research to various scenarios. Additionally, NICE has recently approved Kate’s proposal to draft guidance on elicitation. The findings from our study are expected to make a significant contribution to this effort. Should you require further details about the study, please let me know. 

I am keen to learn more about the level of interest in SEE from ZIN (or TLV?) and NICE. and volunteering to assist you on leading this initiative from our SIG. Furthermore, I am interested in understanding whether there is overlap among participants with an interest in this topic, as it might be beneficial to consolidate discussions. Please let me know your thoughts. 

As mentioned during our call today, We have 3 abstracts accepted, including one workshop and two forums, for the EU ISPOR 2024.
