### EU HTA training 2025

The EFSPI Scientific and Training Academy has discussed EU HTA training as a potentially relevant topic to target in 2025. Jonas Hägströmm from the Scientific and Training Academy will come by the January SIG meeting to discuss the opportunities (and the general role of the EFSPI Scientific and Training Academy).

### New EU HTA guidance documents

Several hundred pages of guidance documents were released early December - Martin Scott has kindly volunteered to point to some highlights.
You can find the documents on the [European Commission HTA website](https://health.ec.europa.eu/health-technology-assessment/key-documents_en?f%5B0%5D=topic_topic%3A225&f%5B1%5D=topic_topic%3A226&f%5B2%5D=topic_topic%3A227&f%5B3%5D=topic_topic%3A228&f%5B4%5D=topic_topic%3A236) for the recently adipted guidance documents on:


### 2025 HTA ESIG targets

At the January meeting, we will align on SIG targets for 2025. Please have a look at our [2024 targets](https://htaesig.github.io/about/) before the January meeting - some of these we will most likely roll over to 2025, while others will requir updating (for example the engagement targets).

One of the things that we hope to push more in 2025 is the visiblity of our various subteams. As part of that, we will do a "service check" of the subteams during January to ensure that we have an up-to-date overview of the **active** subteams. More info will provided at the January meeting.
