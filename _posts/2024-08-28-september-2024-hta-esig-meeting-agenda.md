## Updates from chairs
### Streamlined meeting planning/execution
Now that Emma, with her amazing admin and planning skills, has left the HTA ESIG, we’ve decided to further streamline the planning and execution of our monthly ESIG meetings. 

Moving forward, we will:

-	Strengthen the focus on member/subteam/guest driven topics
-	Implement a standardized 5-point agenda for all SIG meetings (see above) 
    -	We’ll include ‘teasers’ for the topics that we know will be covered – of course leaving room for impromptu discussions and news around EU HTA and events/conferences parts 
-	**Not** pre-distribute slides ahead of meetings – but ask members to present slides from their own devices as needed and share slides with Lara and me after the meeting instead

We will still record the meetings for those that are unable to attend.

In addition, Milana has kindly volunteered to help Lara and Anders keep things on track – thanks Milana!

### Member contributions
The value of the HTA ESIG comes from its’ member-driven nature. As I think Michael S framed it, it provides a way
 of ‘tapping into the hive mind of European HTA statisticians. As HTA statisticians take center stage in the coming years,
 this kind of forum becomes more important than ever.

We urge all members to continue sharing topics of interest for future meetings with Lara and myself. Whether it's a 
subject you'd like to present, learn about, or discuss with your peers, **your** input is essential to shaping our community discussions and efforts!
