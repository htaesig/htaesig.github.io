## Updates from chairs

### New leadership model proposal

Anders, Katrin, and Arthur met and aligned on the proposal below for an updated leadership model.

Importantly, the proposal involves that Katrin and Arthur will step into SIG leadership to replace Anders, effective 06-May, while Lara will stay on for the rest of 2025 to ensure continuity. 

Thanks a lot to Katrin and Arthur for taking this on - I (Anders) am looking very much forward to continue as a regular SIG member under their co-leadership!

- SIG leadership consists of 3 people, for robustness and sharing of admin workload
  - Formal/internal roles: chair, chair-elect, incoming chair
  - Frame outwards simply as ‘co-chair’, with co-chairs deciding among themselves how to distribute responsibilities
- Each leader serves a 2-year term in total
  -	Annual rotation: Chair steps down, Chair-Elect becomes Chair, Incoming Chair becomes Chair-Elect, we recruit a new Incoming Chair
  -	Rotation example:
    -	Year 1: A (Chair), B (Chair-Elect), C (Incoming)
    -	Year 2: B (Chair), C (Chair-Elect), D (Incoming)
-	Benefits:
  -	Continuity: Always have an experienced Chair
  -	Fresh perspectives: New leader joins annually
  -	Mentorship: Chair guides Chair-Elect, who then guides Incoming Chair
-	Transition to the new model (with Anders stepping down after 06-May meeting)
  -	Lara will have the role as ‘Chair’ 
  -	Katrin and Arthur will step in to fill ‘Chair-elect’ + ‘Incoming’ roles
-	First election end 2025:
  -	Lara to step down, one of Arthur or Katrin taking on a chair role (-> serving until end 2026), the other the chair-elect role (-> serving until end 2027)
