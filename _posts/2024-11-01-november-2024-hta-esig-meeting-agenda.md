## Updates from chairs

### JSC medicinal products implementing acts
The JSC medicinal products implementing acts was in review during October. We did not provide comments on behalf of EFSPI/HTA ESIG because we saw limited opportunity for adding perspectives that others wouldn't - at the November SIG meeting, we will briefly catch up on this IA. 

### PSI 2025
Wembley Stadium, London from Sunday 1st – Wednesday 4th June 2025. Deadline for (oral) abstracts 23-Nov. There has been some surprises with the new submission system so it may be a good idea to test it early to avoid last-minute surprises. 

### R Consortium HTA WG kickoff
We encourage ESIG members to join this initiative - or nudge others in your organization who might be relevant contributors.
