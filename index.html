<p>The  Health Technology Assessment (HTA) European Special Interest Group, sponsored by <a href="https://www.psiweb.org/">PSI</a> and <a href="https://efspi.org/">EFSPI</a>, is a fast-growing community of around 100 professionals working in HTA statistics. 
  Our SIG provides a platform for connecting people across companies and geographies to discuss industry developments, organize events, and advance scientific knowledge and best practices in HTA statistics.</p>

<p>We meet  monthly to:</p>

<ul>
<li>Share recent developments in HTA statistics</li>
<li>Discuss how to advance the <a href="https://htaesig.github.io/about/">objectives of the HTA SIG</a></li>
<li> Collaborate on specialized HTA statistics topics through our <a href="https://htaesig.github.io/subteams/">subteams</a></li>
</ul>

<h2>What is HTA statistics?</h2>
<p>HTA statistics is the application of statistics to Health Technology Assessment: the scientific process that helps authorities decide medical technologies and treatments are effective and worth paying for. </p>

<p>HTA statisticians are the "swiss army knives" among pharma statisticians - they handle a broad range of topics, from analysis of clinical trial data and (network) meta analysis to health economic modelling. </p>
<p> With the evolving policy landscape, in particular <a href="https://health.ec.europa.eu/health-technology-assessment_en">pan-European HTA</a>, there's a growing need for 
  statisticians who can successfully navigate the unique context of HTA. </p>
