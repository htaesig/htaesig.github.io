# Introduction 
## What is HTA?

The definition of HTA has been adapted over time, with different bodies having developed their own working definitions. However, O’Rourke *et al.* announced the ‘new’ definition of HTA in 2020 based on an international joint task group comprising representatives of the International Network of Agencies for HTA (INAHTA); Health Technology Assessment International (HTAi); The Professional Society for Health Economics and Outcomes Research (ISPOR); the regional HTA networks in Europe (EUnetHTA), Asia (HTAsiaLink), and the Americas (RedETSA); and the HTA Glossary Committee. The following definition was determined:

> Health technology assessment (HTA) is a multidisciplinary process that uses explicit methods to determine
> the value of a health technology at different points in its lifecycle. The purpose is to inform decision
> making in order to promote an equitable, efficient, and high-quality health system

A health technology is an intervention developed to prevent, diagnose, or treat medical conditions; promote health; provide rehabilitation; or organize healthcare delivery. The intervention can be a test, device, medicine, vaccine, procedure, program, or system. HTA can be used as a tool in decision-making and policy-making to bridge the gap between research, clinical practice and public policy.
