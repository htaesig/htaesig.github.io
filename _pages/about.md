HTA statistics is the application of statistics to Health Technology Assessment (HTA): the scientific process that helps authorities decide medical technologies and treatments are effective and worth paying for. HTA statisticians are the "swiss army knives" among pharma statisticians - they handle a broad range of topics, from analysis of clinical trial data and (network) meta analysis to health economic modelling. 

 With the evolving policy landscape, in particular <a href="https://health.ec.europa.eu/health-technology-assessment_en">pan-European HTA</a>, there's a growing need for 
  statisticians who can navigate the unique context of HTA. The HTA European Special Interest Group, sponsored by [PSI (Statisticians in the Pharmaceutical Industry)](https://www.psiweb.org/) and [EFSPI (European Federation of Statisticians in the Pharmaceutical Industry)](https://www.efspi.org/), connects professionals across companies and geographies to discuss industry developments, organize events, and advance scientific knowledge and best practices in HTA statistics

## Objectives 

1. **Empower HTA statisticians, through a platform for sharing and co-developing best practices.**<br/>
*Shape a platform where HTA statisticians can exchange insights, share experiences, and collaboratively develop best practices, enhancing their role and fostering leadership*
2. **Foster interdisciplinary and intradisciplinary scientific dialogue on HTA statistical matters.**<br/>
 *Foster discussions within the statistician community and across other disciplines to deepen the understanding of HTA statistical matters and foster collaboration.*
3. **Utilize our collective HTA statistical expertise to provide influential input to policy-making.**<br/>
 *Harness our collective skills and experience to deliver expert advice to influence HTA and regulatory policy-making.*
4. **Promote education and awareness about the importance and applications of HTA statistics.**<br/>
    *Broaden awareness of HTA statistics by leading educational initiatives such as webinars or short courses, highlighting the role and significance of HTA statistics.*
